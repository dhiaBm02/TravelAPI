## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm
- PostgreSQL

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://code.fbi.h-da.de/stdhbenme/fwe-ss-24-1116625.git
    cd fwe-ss-24-1116625
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a new database schema
    - First, connect to your PostgreSQL database using the `psql` command-line or a GUI like `pgAdmin`.
    
    - Once connected to the PostgreSQL database, create a new schema.

    - Open your `.env` file and add or update your database connection details.

4. Configure environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    CSC_API_KEY = 'RjlSdmk2d1NHWnNHZlk3dHJrVEo1ZWtubUtBbzhxMzZ0R05zTU1HcA=='
    OW_API_KEY = '009f8f00a19d5951a35d1dd3e84ff5fb'
    environment = 'dev'
    DB_NAME = 'postgres'
    DB_USER = 'postgres'
    DB_PASSWORD = 'your_pwd'
    DB_SCHEMA = 'your_schema_name'
    ```

5. create the database schema
    ```bash
    npm run schema:fresh
    ```

6. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Usage

For more understanding how the API works and what it is needed for every request you can render the [openapispec.yml](api-fwe-ss24.yml) file in a [swagger editor tool](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/).


## Testing

### Automated Tests
1. Adjust the environment variables for the test environment:
    Update the `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    CSC_API_KEY = 'RjlSdmk2d1NHWnNHZlk3dHJrVEo1ZWtubUtBbzhxMzZ0R05zTU1HcA=='
    OW_API_KEY = '009f8f00a19d5951a35d1dd3e84ff5fb'
    environment = 'test'
    DB_NAME = 'postgres'
    DB_USER = 'postgres'
    DB_PASSWORD = 'your_pwd'
    DB_SCHEMA = 'your_schema_name'
    ```

2. To run automated tests, use the following command:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm test
    ```

## Frontend

for more understanding i made a demo video that could help you understand how to interact with the web interface.
Here's a quick demo of how it works:

[![Demo](frontend/public/assets/HomePage.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW0K5M8eScw)

- List view and Detail view for trips.
- List view and Detail view for destinations.
- Create, update, and delete trips.
- Create, update, and delete destinations.
- Search trips by name or date.
- View all trips for a specific destination.

### Frontend Structure

- **Components**
  - TripListView: Displays a list of trips.
  - TripDetaislView: Displays details of a single trip.
  - DestinationListView: Displays a list of destinations.
  - DestinationDetailsView: Displays details (+ country and weather infos) of a single destination.
  - TripForm / Edit-Delete Icon: Form for creating and editing trips.
  - DestinationForm / Edit-Delete Icon: Form for creating and editing destinations.
  - Calendar Icon: Download .ics file for a specific destination and add it to the user's Calendar.

- **Routes / Links**
  - `/`: HomePage.
  - `/trips`: TripsListView.
  - `/trips/:id`: TripDetailsView.
  - `/destinations`: DestinationsListView.
  - `/destinations/:id`: DestinationDetailsView.


### Installation

make sure that the backend runs and the `environment` in the `.env` file is not `test`, then do the following steps:

7. go to the frontend repository:
    ```bash
    cd fwe-ss-24-1116625
    cd frontend
    ```

8. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

9. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
The HomePage will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
